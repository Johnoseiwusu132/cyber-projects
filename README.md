# Cybersecurity Projects

This repository contains my practice projects in cybersecurity using Python.  
These projects showcase basic skills in **network security, password strength testing, and monitoring.**

## Projects

### 1. Vulnerability Scanner
- Scans a given host and checks for open ports.
- Helps identify which services might be running.

### 2. Keylogger (Educational Use Only)
- Captures keystrokes locally.
- Demonstrates how attackers log input â€” built only for learning ethical hacking concepts.

### 3. Password Strength Checker
- Tests passwords against common patterns and weaknesses.
- Gives feedback on improving password security.
